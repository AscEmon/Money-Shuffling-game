ITs a simple ai game ,where user and  computer are playing. I made this Ai project for my Artificial intelligence sessional lab.

Actually its a guessing game.In this game  user guesses the glass where money are covered by the glass.
If user select the orginal glass then user got one point.

On the Contrary ,computer also guess the glass where user put the money and its covered by the glass.
If the computer select the orginal glass then computer got a one point.


Finally select the win ,draw or lose on the basis of the point.
